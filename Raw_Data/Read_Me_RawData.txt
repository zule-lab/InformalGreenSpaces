This is the raw data collected over the summer of 2023. 

Some sensors end earlier than others, which is taken into account in the compiled data files.
Cdes_2 was actually stolen/lost and could not be found. As such there is the data from before it was lost
(CdesP_#2), and the replacement (CdesP_#2_2).
