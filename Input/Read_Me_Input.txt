These compiled files contain the 2023 data that has been trimmed down.

The data was trimmed in order to remove data point for certain sensors which had faulty readings
when before the battery died. Furthermore, to make sure that all sensors ended at similar times 
the data for all sensors in a particular green space were trimmed to match (or closely match)
the earliest sensor death. For example, all falaise sensors were cut down to 8/22 because
that is when the first sensors died.
